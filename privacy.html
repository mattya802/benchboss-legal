        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Bench Boss ("we", "our", or "the app") is a youth sports lineup management application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.</p>

            <li>Game schedules and lineup configurations</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All of this data is stored locally on your device only. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your team or player data on external servers. We have no access to this information.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>The free version of the app displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google may collect certain information for advertising purposes, including:</p>

        <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>Purchases are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any payment information. All transactions are handled by Apple or Google according to their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Since all app data is stored locally on your device, we do not use your personal information for any purpose. The app functions entirely offline.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except:</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app is designed for coaches managing youth sports teams. While coaches may enter player names, we encourage using first names only or nicknames. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children. All data remains on the coach's device.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Your data remains on your device until you delete it within the app or uninstall the app. We have no access to your data and cannot delete it remotely.</p>
